# DriversPass

Copy of the DriverPass presentation & buisness documents. 

As part of the DriverPass project, I worked with a client who wanted an online tool to help kids get ready for their driving tests. The system had to give users access to study tools, keep track of their work, and let them plan and run their lessons. I worked on making a system that was secure, easy to use, and scalable so that it could be reached from a variety of devices. I was able to make a system that worked well and was easy for people to use by really knowing what the client wanted and thinking like they would use it.

One of the best things about my job was that I focused on security and user experience to make sure the system was safe and simple to use. On the other hand, if I had to change anything about the project, it would be the parts that make it easier to handle more people. When I create software, I make sure I understand what the client wants by using use case models and getting feedback on a regular basis to make sure the system works well as it changes. This method, along with iterative planning and feedback from users, helps make software that really solves users' problems and meets their wants.
